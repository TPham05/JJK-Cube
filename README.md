# ðŸ§Š JJK-Inspired Arduino Project: Random Eye Movement  

This project is inspired by the anime *Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK)* and demonstrates random eye movement using servos controlled by an Arduino. The code utilizes the **Adafruit PWM Servo Driver** library to simulate organic and lifelike eye movements.  

## Features  
- **Randomized Eye Movement**: Five independent servos move randomly to mimic natural eye motion.  
- **Adjustable Speed and Timing**: Each servo operates with varying speeds and delays for realistic behavior.  
- **Adafruit PWM Servo Driver**: Handles multiple servos with precise control.  
- **C++ Implementation**: The project is written in C++ for Arduino, utilizing efficient code structures.  

## Components Used  
- **Arduino Board**: Any Arduino-compatible board (e.g., Uno, Mega).  
- **Adafruit PWM Servo Driver**: For controlling multiple servos.  
- **Servos**: Five servos to simulate the eye movements.  
- **Miscellaneous**: Jumper wires, breadboard, power supply.  

## How It Works  
1. **Randomized Targets**: Each servo is assigned random target positions within a defined range.  
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Servos move incrementally to their target positions for smooth and lifelike motion.  
3. **Dynamic Timing**: Random delays and speeds are applied to make the movements less predictable.  
4. **Continuous Operation**: The program loops indefinitely, creating a random motion effect.
